# CoinFlip

This custom smart contract called CoinFlipWinner calculates if the CoinFlip will be heads or tails.

Steps to reproduce :

- Deploy the smart contract on the same network(ropsten testnet) as the CoinFlip contract (because it needs block number)
- Call the `flip` function 10 times (wait a block validation between each call), with the CoinFlip contract address as a parameter

You can use the [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) to develop and deploy smart contracts, and interact with them (e.g. send transactions).
You can also deploy and interact with contracts with most Ethereum Wallets (e.g [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com))
You can use [Metamask](https://metamask.io) to sign transactions in your browser.
