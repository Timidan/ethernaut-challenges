# Solving [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.zeppelin.solutions) challenges.

The ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired on overthewire.org and the El Eternauta comic, played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked' in order to advance.
i will be updating this repositories with my solutions as i progress.
